        <h3>3. General notes and mandatory information</h3>
        <p>
          Data protection<br>
          <br>
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. 
          We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration.
          When you use this website, various personal data are collected. 
          Personal data is data by which you can be personally identified. 
          This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it. 
          It also explains how this is done and for what purpose.<br>
          We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. 
          Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br>
          <br>
          Note on the responsible body<br>
          <br>
          The responsible party for data processing on this website is:<br>
          <br>
          Jonathan Wei√ü<br>
          Brunnleite<br>
          93047 Regensburg<br>
          Phone: 01575/8447646<br>
          Email: regensburgaltpro@gmail.com<br>
          <br>
          The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).<br>
          <br>
          Withdrawal of your consent to data processing<br>
          <br>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. 
          You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. 
          For this purpose, an informal communication by e-mail to us is sufficient. 
          The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.<br>
          <br>
          Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)<br>
          <br>
          IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; 
          THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. 
          THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. 
          IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 ABS. 1 DSGVO).<br>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSES OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH MARKETING; 
          THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. 
          IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL FOLLOWALLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (objection under Article 21(2) of the GDPR).
          <br>
          Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority<br>.
          <br>
          In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. 
          The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.<br>
          <br>
          Right to data portability<br>
          <br>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. 
          If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.<br>
          <br>
          Information, deletion and correction<br>
          <br>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. 
          For this purpose as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint.<br>
          <br>
          Right to restriction of processing<br>
          <br>
          You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. 
          To do this, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. 
          The right to restriction of processing applies in the following cases:<br>
          <br>
          If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. 
          For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br>
          If the processing of your personal data has happened/is happening unlawfully, you can ask for the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.<br>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.<br>
          If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br>
          <br> 
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.<br>

        <h3>4. Data collection on this website</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies<br>
          <br>
          To our knowledge, our website does not use cookies of any kind<br>.
          <br>
          Some of the Internet pages use so-called cookies. 
          Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. 
          Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, effective and secure. 
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
          Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". 
          They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. 
          Other cookies remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them. 
          These cookies enable us to recognise your browser on your next visit.<br>
          You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. 
          If you deactivate cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.<br>
          Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide certain functions that you have requested (e.g. shopping basket function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of its services. 
          If a corresponding consent has been requested (e.g. consent to store cookies), the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO; 
          the consent can be revoked at any time.<br>
          Insofar as other cookies (e.g. cookies to analyse your surfing behaviour) are stored, these are dealt with separately in this data protection declaration.<br>
          <br>
          Request by e-mail or telephone<br>
          <br>
          If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your enquiry including all personal data arising from it (name, enquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. 
          We do not pass on this data without your consent.<br>
          The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. 
          In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) and/or on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO), as we have a legitimate interest in effectively processing the enquiries sent to us.<br>
          The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after we have completed processing your request). 
          Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.
